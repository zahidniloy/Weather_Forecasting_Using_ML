# Weather_Forecasting_Using_ML
A series of machine learning exercises focused on predicting pleasant weather conditions across Europe using real-world meteorological data, developed for the ClimateWins project.
# ClimateWins: ML-Based Weather Prediction Project 🌦️

## Overview
This project series applies machine learning to forecast pleasant weather conditions across various European cities. Developed for a fictitious non-profit—**ClimateWins**—these models aim to support climate resilience and planning efforts amid changing global conditions.

The work includes exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and model comparison using real-world meteorological data collected from 18 weather stations.

## Data Sources
The weather data used was sourced from the **European Climate Assessment & Dataset project**, including daily observations from 1960 through 2022.
